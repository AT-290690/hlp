;; Boxlines
;; Given a * [X; Y; Z] box built by arranging * [1; 1; 1] unit boxes, 
;; write a function f [X; Y; Z] that returns the number of edges (hence, boxlines) of length 1 (both inside and outside of the box)

;; Notes
;; Adjacent unit boxes share the same edges, so a 2*1*1 box will have 20 edges, not 24 edges
;; X,Y and Z are strictly positive, and can go as large as 2^16 - 1

;; [1; 1; 1] -> 12 - 1
;; [2; 1; 1] -> 20 - 2
;; [2; 2; 2] -> 54 - 4
